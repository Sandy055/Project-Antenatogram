# Project-Antenatogram

Development of a Full-Stack Web Application, (name TBD) that empowers gestating women to have complete control over their medical records dealing with their pregnancy. Will encompass a user base of both patients and doctors, thereby enabling the patient to carry a digital record of their pregnancy to any doctor w/o prior context while also allowing the doctor to analyse several pregnant patients from a unified platform. Project will be built on the web, primarily focused on mobile use.
